            <p>In the 20th century, when technology changed our world, We can use technology for entertainment, education, communication, and other uses for free. Were the creators to think that the impossible things would still be impossible, we wouldn’t have the innovation that changed the world, and many people haven’t had the opportunity to study the interesting things. It is important that we learn to think about everything, even if it is possible or not.</p>

            <h2> > Design Thinking</h2>
            <p> Design thinking is a recursive procedure that is used to recognize users, challenge suppositions, reconsider problems, build an innovative solution, prototype it, and evaluate it. Design thinking requires using the user's needs to find the solution and modify it to make most people's problems impossible. It has 5 steps of design thinking. </p>

            <h2> > Empathize</h2>
            <p> The first step of design thinking to fix the user's problem is to observe and ask the user questions. It enables us to establish the suppositions. </p>
