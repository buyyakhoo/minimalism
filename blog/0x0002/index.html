            <h1>> Why students haven't enjoyed to learn in school?</h1>
            <p>Hello guys, I know you're tired of studying in school and so bored with the teacher that gives 
                you a lot of homework, memorizing and preparing for the examination and forgetting everything, 
                and this is the reason why students haven't enjoyed to learn in school? 
            </p>
            <h2>> Education system is outdated</h2>
            <p>It cannot be denied that the education system is outdated because we must learn something useless 
                or won't use it in the future. (e.g., Reciting the periodic table, it's very difficult to memorize 
                the whole periodic table, or reciting poetry.) 
            </p>
            <h2>> Study for exam and then forget it</h2>
            <p>Teachers right now taught the students to memorize the information for the exam more than taught 
                students to have creativity or inspire students to have the passion to do in the future. 
            </p>
            <h2>> Students have a lot of homeworks</h2>
            <p>It cannot be denied that every day students have homework for every subject to do for marks. Some 
                students don't have time to find themselves what do they want to do when they grow up.
            </p>
            <h2>> Limited Of Learning</h2>
            <p>Some parents want their children to be doctors, and engineers for money and didn't think their son 
                what do son what to do, so parents push their children's tuition and pay more money to expect a 
                child to get A+ grades. This case will have a problem when children don't want to be that parents 
                want their children to be something that doesn't want to be. 
            </p>
            <h2>> Follow the direction</h2>
            <p>People who have been taught in school are to follow the direction so, students have to download 
                knowledge that students don't know when it has to use in future and student must use skills to 
                work in future but the school doesn't teach? The education system did not let students make 
                mistakes otherwise, students will be punished. 
            </p>
