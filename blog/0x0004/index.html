            <h1> >> Get to know the Interleaving Study</h1>

            <p>As a child, I liked to do anything and explore everything that I wanted to know and do. I study anything from questioning what and why to learning by playing, which is fun and helps me develop many skills. I know that the education system is outdated. I mean, the way of teaching that forces the 50 students in the classroom to learn by following and memorizing the stuff is so outdated that I don’t even know how this topic will be used or how it will be implemented and developed. And the result of this outdated education system is that the PISA examination score in Thailand compared to the rest of the world is very low. The education system topic will be discussed in the next blog.</p>

            <h2> > Why Interleaving Study?</h2>
            <p> As you can see, the education system almost exclusively uses block study, where students study a topic entirely before moving on to the next topic. We have to study step by step and remember everything before moving on to the next topic. The interleaving study is a study strategy that switches between topics, although the previous topic is not finished studying, and we can go back to the previous topic to review and continue to study. This study topic quite shuffled between the topic and more freedom to study. My research shows that the interleaving study will help students visualize to connect each topic together to think more complexly and use knowledge to apply to problem solving skills, e.g., I can improve my understanding of calculus, so I can view inside of calculus of this subject to improve the algorithm. This situation will improve problem solving and long-term memory.</p>

            <h2> > From My Experience</h2>
            <p>I think that some of my learning situation is interleaving, so this learning plan comes from studying AI while I learn website development to use with AI. I mean, these study strategies require more effortful studying, feel harder than blocked study, but are good at building long-term memories that come from real understanding and solving real-world problems.</p>
